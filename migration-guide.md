1. Go to the "Transfer files" download management page using the left menu _(1)_ or enter the address in the address bar of your browser `https://your_domain_name/wp-admin/admin.php?page=uploadcare-transfer`.

2. On this page you will see images available for uploading to Uploadcare server or downloading to your server. The indicator marked in green _(2)_ indicates that the image is available for downloading.

3. Click on the "download" button _(3)_. The download will start immediately.

4. After successful download to your server, the indicator _(2)_ will change its color to "red".

5. Do this procedure with all the images you want to upload to your server. You can transfer all files __on the page__ by clicking "Transfer all files from Uploadcare" on the top.

Note: If during usage you've changed API keys in your plugin settings (Tools → Uploadcare menu → Settings), make sure you use keys from the right [project](https://app.uploadcare.com).
